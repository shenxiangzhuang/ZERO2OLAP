CubesViewer - OLAP Visual Viewer and Explore Tool
=================================================

About
-----

CubesViewer is a visual, web-based tool for exploring and analyzing
OLAP databases served by the Cubes OLAP Framework.

CubesViewer can be used for data exploration and auditory,
generation of reports, chart designing and embedding,
and as a (simple) company-wide analytics application.

CubesViewer is a visual interface for the
open source [Cubes server](http://databrewery.org/cubes.html) (an OLAP server in Python).
Purpose is to keep it simple while leveraging the web services provided by Cubes.

See it live: [CubesViewer site](http://www.cubesviewer.com/).

Features:

* Dimension hierarchies, date filtering
* Several charts and diagrams can be created
* Explore, create data series, draw charts, see raw facts
* Export data and images

Latest CubesViewer stable release is 2.0.2:

* CubesViewer 2.0.2
  * [cubesviewer-v2.0.2.zip](https://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer/archive/v2.0.2.zip)
  * [cubesviewer-server-v2.0.2.zip](https://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer-server/archive/v2.0.2.zip)
  * [Changelog](http://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer/blob/v2.0.2/CHANGES.txt)
  * [Release Notes](http://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer/blob/v2.0.2/RELEASE-NOTES.txt)
  * Works with *Cubes 1.0.x* and *Cubes 1.1.x*

CubesViewer Server already includes the CubesViewer library so you just need that package
if you plan to deploy the server-side application.

If you do modifications to the project, cloning both repositories via `git` is encouraged, so you can
easily contribute your fixes and improvements back.

Requirements
------------

CubesViewer consists of two parts:

**CubesViewer client** is an HTML5 application that runs on any modern browser.
It can run without server side support. **Simply download the package and open**
`html/studio.html` in your favorite browser. Views can also be embedded in other sites.

CubesViewer also features an optional **server side application**
which provides a full web application and supports features like sharing/saving views.
This project lives on a separate repository: [CubesViewer Server](http://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer-server)
(not to be confused with Cubes Server itself).

You need a configured and running [Cubes Server](http://databrewery.org/cubes.html) version 1.0.x or later.
Your Cubes model may use some extra configuration if you wish to use features like date
filters and range filters (see Documentation below).

For CubesViewer clients to connect to Cubes server ("slicer"), your Cubes server possibly needs to allow
cross origin resource sharing (CORS). To enable it, add `allow_cors_origin: *`
(or a more restrictive setting) under the `[server]` section of the `slicer.ini` file.

For further information, see the Documentation section below.

Documentation
-------------

This tool allows users to inspect the different dimensions, measures and
aggregated data in different ways, allowing you to build tables and charts
based on the analytical data available from the server.
